N1020 – Entrepreneurship and Small BusinessGuidelines for Group PresentationsDuring the course of this module, each of you will be involved in giving a group presentation. There are three main reasons for making group presentations:1. sharing what you have learned with your peers for their educational benefit;2. equipping you to make strong and effective presentations to others in the real world;3. enhancing your ability to judge your work and that of others by asking questions or anticipating themBelow you will find some guidelines designed to help you to effectively plan and deliver this presentation.1. The question to be addressed by the group will be given 2 weeks beforehand.2. All groups must be created by end of Week 4 (18th October).3. Each presentation will not exceed 10 minutes and will be made by ALL group members, followed by 5 minutes of QA where questions are posed by the Tutor and the Discussant group. The role of the Discussant group is to provide peer review in a detailed and professional manner. All other groups will score the presentation using the provided template.4. All presentations will use Powerpoint (or similar). The presentation should not have more than FIVE slides excluding Introduction slide with title of presentation / names of students. The presentations should be emailed to the relevant seminar tutor on, or before 17.00, on the day before presentation. There will be mark deductions for late presentations.5. Informal feedback will be given by the Tutor, both to the class as a whole, and privately to the Group after the presentation. Written feedback will follow shortly but marks will only be given once all the presentations have been delivered.6. Know Your Topic - Do the research first and know your material. Think through what you will present. The best classroom presentations are created by students who are comfortable with what they are going to talk about. In order to achieve this you need to make sure you understand the question well – think of what the magic words in the question are and focus on those.7. Make clear which academic (or other type of) references you have used. There is no requirement about number of references to cite but make sure to engage with module material and the reading list.8. Remember that a good presentation contains exposition (presenting facts), analysis (presenting an interpretation of those facts) and communication (presenting effectively).9. Speak (DON’T READ) the presentation - The purpose of a presentation is to give the audience your ideas about a topic, not to read out chunks of代 写N1020 – Entrepreneurship and Small BusinessPython

Ideally, practice more than once.12. Be as ‘professional’ as possible throughout (although no formal dress code is expected).
